## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Detect duplicate posts by **title** and **slug**
- ✅ Display all duplicates in a table (with checkboxes)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Go to **Tools > Duplicate Post Manager**
2. Click **Scan for Duplicates**
3. Review the table of duplicate posts
4. For each post:
   - Check the box to delete it
   - Choose a redirect target (dropdown or custom URL)
5. Click **Delete Selected & Redirect**
6. Scroll down to copy or export your `.htaccess` redirect rules

## 🧠 Redirect Format

The plugin generates Apache `.htaccess` rules like:

```

# BEGIN Post Redirects

Redirect 301 /old-slug /new-slug
Redirect 301 /another-old /new-target

# END Post Redirects

```

- All redirects use **relative paths** for portability.
- Only valid (non-404) redirects are saved.

## 💡 Why Use It?

- Maintain your site's authority by preserving link equity  
- Clean and update old auto-imported posts or legacy content
